## Project Overview

### Introduction

In this project, I have developed a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create realistic images of human faces. These images feature celebrities and are generated using the CelebA dataset, which has been preprocessed for this purpose.

## Model Training and Results

After training the GAN for 100 epochs, the model has learned to generate high-quality facial images. Here are some examples of faces generated by the model:

These generated faces showcase the capabilities of the GAN in producing realistic facial features.
